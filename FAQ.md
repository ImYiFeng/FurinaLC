# Frequently Asked Question
### 1. Is this safe to use?
No. Don't expect me to try convincing you or something. Use it, or don't. I don't care.

### 2. How do I mod/customize identity skills, play as ricardo etc.?
This is just a private server, not a modding tool. 

### 3. I get a server error when I do X ingame!
X is probably not implemented. Feel free to implement it and make a pull request.

### 4. The game has updated, there is a new ID/EGO/etc., how do I give myself everything?
First, you want to update your git submodules by running `git submodule update â€“remote`.

Then, go to FAQ number 5 and read the sync command.

### 4. Are there commands?
Yes. You can use them through the coupon menu. Current commands are such:

(Note: they aren't case sensitive, as limbus client automatically uppercases the input when sending to the server)

- RESET

    This command will reset a user's database to default.

- SYNC

    This command will update your owned stuff, making sure it's up to date with the latest limbus stuff. Make sure the git submodule is updated before running this.

- P

    Usage example is like this "P10101L50G4". This will set a personality (identity) with an id of 10101 to level 50 and gacksung (uptie) 4.

- E

    Does the same like P, except it's for egos, and you can only change gacksung. Example: "E20101G4".

- I

    This command is used to update an item count. For example, "I11C100", will make you have 100 of item with the id 11.

- U

    This command is used to update user info. Example: "U1L100S100" will make a user with uid 1 be level 100 and have 100 stamina.
